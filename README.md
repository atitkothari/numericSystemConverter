There are two numbering systems that I have to deal with daily.

One is the Indian numbering system, and the other is the western system.

Indian system is in thousands, lakhs, crore, lakh-crore/arab, while the western system is in thousands, millions, billions, trillions.

Then there is the comma!

10 lakh is equal to 1 million but expressed as 10,00,000 in the Indian system and 1,000,000 in the western system. Now, if these numbers are currencies, specifically rupees(INR) and dollars(\$), there is a foreign exchange rate.

There are too many moving parts to convert numbers from one system to another. I found myself googling every time for a converter, but these converters are too sophisticated and offer a lot of units that I don't care about + terrible user interface.

I wrote a simple converter that does one thing very well. It takes just one input and converts it to the Indian number system as well as the western system.

You can find it here: https://croretobillion.netlify.app/

It also shows value in Rs and \$ at the same time, using the real-time exchange rate from here: https://exchangeratesapi.io/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
